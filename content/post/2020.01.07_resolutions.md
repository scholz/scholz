# Getting ahead in 2020

In the last two years I have been coordinating development efforts
at a larger company. However, while I have advanced
my soft skills and extended my dev ops and management knowhow, I believe there are
a number of technologies which I have the strong urge to experiment with
and which I have a hard time to look into at my primary job.

Therefore the major goal for this year is to enhance
and deepen my knowledge in a number of exciting areas by building
projects to practice and apply this know how.

This blog (using static site generation based on HUGO) is one
first venue to inspire and support these aspirations.

Besides that, I want to look into:

* AI (deep learning; pytorch)
* App development (flutter)
* General fullstack development (microservices, webservices, frontend)

Hopefully I will manage to report about these here.

My basis of learning will be (e)books. I think that only books allow
to gain the depth of knowledge needed to fully comprehend the implications
of technical choices.

To whoever finds this blog: I hope there will be something you can enjoy reading.
To my future self: I hope you can find the dedication and time to go ahead with your plan.

So let's get going.
