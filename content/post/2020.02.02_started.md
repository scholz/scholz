## First stop: Flutter
I finally managed to start working on my resolutions. 
The major hold back was making up my mind how to begin
so that I could produce results quickly but also contribute to the complete "road map". I actually started to read
many of the different books I acquired over the last days of 2019 (all from Manning.com).

I finally settled on starting with learning [Flutter](https://flutter.dev/). 

## Reasons for starting with Flutter
* cross platform development with the same look and feel
  * Flutter builds for Android, iOS and web (web only recently added and still considered beta as of today)
  * multiple projects I intend to work on would strongly benefit from cross platform
* learning a new modern language - Flutter is based on Dart a google developed modern language and since I haven't learned a new language in a long time I am really looking forward to that
  * while this may slow me down a bit I hope it compensated by the previous point
* due to the cross platform build I am hoping to use flutter also for the micro service development; I am really curious to see if it is only valuable for the front end or how it is advised to separate the code there; else I guess I'll go for Python on that side
* Flutter hot loading seems really helpful for quick app development
* Looking forward to being able to develop modern web applications (I've been doing Javascript in the 90's but haven't worked in deep with any of the modern frameworks)


## Likely Disadvantages
* Learning a new language will make progress slower then expected
* Learning a new language and creating readable/maintainable/..  code will be challenging
* pyTorch integration will be "interesting"
* Dart is **not** among the top 20 of the most popular languages
  * according to the [TIOBE Index](https://www.tiobe.com/tiobe-index/) in Jan 2020 Dart is ranked 22nd (0.63%) with the top three being Java (16.89%), C (15.77%) and Python (9.70%)
* Dart is a Google project which means it could simply be discontinued at some point
